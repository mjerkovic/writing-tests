Classes to be used for practicing writing unit tests.

Start by writing a unit test for Rational.java

Rational Numbers
================

A rational number n / d is represented by two integers

its numerator n

and

its denominator d

the following operations can be performed on rationals

Addition
========

n1/d1 + n2/d2 = (n1d2+n2d1) / (d1d2)

Subtraction
===========

n1/d1 - n2/d2 = (n1d2-n2d1)/(d1d2)

Multiplication
==============

n1/d1 * n2/d2 = (n1n2) / (d1d2)

Division
========

n1/d1 / n2/d2 = (n1d2) / (d1n2)

Equality
========

n1/d1 = n2/d2 if and only if (iff)  n1d2 = d1n2
